#Deploying the server

By default, we have set up the project so that it can be easily deployed to Heroku for testing and basic hosting.

Please review the [Deploying Django to Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-python) for limitations and a basic overview.

You can follow the steps given [here to create a project and deploy](https://tutorial-extensions.djangogirls.org/en/heroku/)

Please note that we have already set the project up for deployment, including creating the needed Procfile, creating the requirements.txt, setting up local settings, etc.
